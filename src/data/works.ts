            When I joined the project, a rough base page already existed. From
            there, the entire website was handed over to me to take forward.
            What started as a single page slowly grew into a full marketing site
            one that needed clear storytelling, seasonal pages, and a strong
            visual identity.
          </p>
          <div>
            <p>I began by understanding the landscape:</p>
            <ul>
              <li>Running competitive analysis</li>
              <li>Identifying the target audience</li>
              <li>Mapping user flows</li>
              <li>Planning what each page should communicate</li>
            </ul>
          </div>
          <p>
            Once the foundation was set, I moved into designing multiple pages
            focused on seasonal campaigns and service based marketing. The
            marketing manager, Shahal, and his team provided the content, and
            each design went through review cycles with the marketing head,
            founders, and leadership team. This helped maintain clarity in
            communication and consistency in brand tone. A big part of this
            project was also collaboration. I worked closely with the developers
            to ensure the final output matched the design vision. Through this
            back-and-forth, I picked up many practical tricks that made their
            development process smoother and more efficient.
          </p>
          <div>
            <p>
              As development progressed, the scope kept expanding. New pages
              were added, older pages went through iterations, and special
              campaign pages emerged. Some of the key ones included:
            </p>
            <ul>
              <li>IMA Meeting Booking Page</li>
              <li>Diwali Gifting Page</li>
            </ul>
          </div>
          <p>
            Each of these pages had its own purpose and required a tailored
            approach from layout decisions to microcopy to the final user
            journey. By the end of it, the website became more than just a
            marketing platform it became a structured, thoughtful system
            designed to support both everyday communication and high-impact
            seasonal moments.

            Mai-Mai is a South Asian restaurant located in Indiranagar. The goal
            of the website was not just to help users reserve a table, but to
            tell the story of the restaurant through design and create an
            emotional connection even before people visited the place.
          </p>
          <p>
            While working on this project, I focused deeply on the layout and
            overall visual structure of the website. I wanted the design to feel
            authentic and culturally rooted, rather than looking like a typical
            restaurant website. To achieve this, I explored elements of South
            Asian architecture and visual patterns, especially during the early
            stages of designing cards and image borders. I studied how these
            architectural details are structured and translated those forms into
            the UI, using them subtly across key sections of the website to
            reinforce the brand’s identity.
          </p>
          <p>
            My role in this project was to design a storytelling-driven website
            while maintaining the authenticity and brand essence of Mai-Mai. The
            core content and some strategic ideas were shared by the marketing
            team, and I translated those ideas into a cohesive visual experience
            that balanced aesthetics with usability.
          </p>
          <p>
            The website was developed using Wix, and I worked closely with the
            developer throughout the process to ensure the design intent was
            carried through to the final build. We collaborated continuously and
            successfully launched the website on time. This project remains one
            of my most satisfying works, as it reflects my ability to combine
            cultural storytelling, thoughtful design decisions, and real world
            execution.

            A project that pushed me out of my comfort zone and taught me how to
            design at scale.
          </p>
          <p>
            This Flight Booking project came to me with a straightforward line:
            design new features for both B2B and B2C customers. But the moment I
            stepped into it, I realized that it was far more layered than I
            expected. The platform served corporate teams, individual travelers,
            and internal stakeholders, each with different needs and behaviors.
            Taking complete ownership felt exciting and slightly overwhelming at
            the same time, but with consistent guidance from my senior designer,
            the Product Manager, and the leadership team, I started shaping the
            project step by step.
          </p>
          <p>
            I began by grounding myself in research understanding end-user
            expectations, mapping use cases, and running competitive analysis to
            see what the market had normalized. Once the UX direction was clear,
            I moved into the UI phase. And this is where the real challenge
            began. Almost every flight aggregator follows a similar UI pattern,
            and the expectation was to design something better without confusing
            users or breaking familiar behavior. I had to introduce new
            features, simplify the flow, and still keep the overall experience
            predictable. It took multiple rounds of iteration, review sessions
            with senior and PM, and a lot of refining to get the balance right.
          </p>
          <p>
            Designing for both desktop and mobile simultaneously taught me even
            more. Mobile was especially challenging fitting dense information
            into small screens without overwhelming the user. With help from my
            senior designer, I found ways to reorganize layouts and priorities
            details so the experience stayed clean, intuitive, and fast.
            Throughout the process, I made several key design decisions to
            ensure the flow felt smooth and the interactions felt natural.
          </p>
          <p>
            At the same time, I made sure the UI and design assets were
            developer-friendly. Everything followed our design language, was
            easy to hand off, and reduced guesswork during development. By the
            end of it, the design not only met expectations but also added
            clarity and ease to an otherwise complex booking process.
          </p>
          <p>
            This was my first major B2B2C SaaS project, and it genuinely shaped
            me as a designer. I learned how to design at scale, how to
            collaborate better, how to defend decisions, and when to take help.
            I’m grateful to the people who trusted me with this responsibility.
            Looking back, this project pushed me, challenged me, and ultimately
            made me a better designer than I was when I started.

            This feature started as a small internal requirement, but very
            quickly I realized how much impact it actually had. The goal was
            simple on the surface: allow our admin users to control how reward
            points convert into currency. But behind that simplicity was a much
            larger challenge our users were spread across different countries,
            using different currencies, and often managing multiple accounts at
            the same time.
          </p>
          <p>
            Because this feature directly influenced how rewards were valued,
            even a small mistake could affect a large number of end users. So
            before jumping into design, I spent time understanding how our
            internal teams and admin users currently handled these
            configurations, what confused them, and where errors usually
            happened.
          </p>
          <p>
            One of the biggest challenges was designing for a global use case. A
            single user could operate across regions and currencies, which meant
            the UI had to clearly communicate conversions without overwhelming
            the admin. The interface needed to make it obvious what was being
            configured, for which account, and in which currency all without
            forcing the user to think too hard.
          </p>
          <p>
            While designing the solution, I also kept our internal teams in
            mind. This wasn’t a feature only meant to look good; it had to be
            easily understood by support and operations teams who would
            regularly use it to customise settings for different clients. With
            guidance from my senior designers, I focused on keeping the
            interface clean, predictable, and aligned with our existing design
            language.
          </p>
          <p>
            In the end, the feature came together as a simple, functional UI
            that hid the complexity behind it. Admin users could confidently
            customize point values for different currencies, internal teams
            could manage configurations without confusion, and the overall
            system became more scalable for future use cases.
          </p>
          <p>
            Even though this feature was small in scope, it reinforced an
            important lesson for me: internal tools deserve just as much design
            attention as user-facing features because they quietly power the
            entire product experience.
